## The Odds of Winning the Traditional Lottery

To calculate the odds of winning the lotto, we need to determine the total number of possible combinations and the number of winning combinations.

In this case, you are picking 6 numbers from a range of 1 to 59.

The total number of possible combinations can be calculated using the formula for combinations:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)

Where:
n = total number of choices (59 in this case)
k = number of choices to be made (6 in this case)

Using this formula, the total number of possible combinations is:

C(59, 6) = 59! / (6! * (59 - 6)!)

The number of winning combinations is simply 1 since there is only one winning combination.

Therefore, the odds of winning the lotto with these parameters are:

1 / (59! / (6! * (59 - 6)!))

To calculate the actual numerical value, you would need to evaluate this expression using a calculator or programming language with support for large numbers.

## The Odds of Winning this Lottery

If you are picking 5 numbers from a range of 1 to 39, we can calculate the odds of winning the lotto by following a similar approach as before.

The total number of possible combinations can be calculated using the combination formula:

C(n, k) = n! / (k! * (n - k)!)

Where:
n = total number of choices (39 in this case)
k = number of choices to be made (5 in this case)

Using this formula, the total number of possible combinations is:

C(39, 5) = 39! / (5! * (39 - 5)!)

The number of winning combinations is still 1.

Therefore, the odds of winning the lotto with these parameters are:

1 / (39! / (5! * (39 - 5)!))

To calculate the actual numerical value, you would need to evaluate this expression using a calculator or programming language with support for large numbers.

## What Does This Mean?

To evaluate the expressions:

1 / (59! / (6! * (59 - 6)!))

1 / (39! / (5! * (39 - 5)!))

we can use a calculator or a programming language to compute the actual values.

The first expression evaluates to approximately 1 in 45,057,474.

The second expression evaluates to approximately 1 in 575,757.

To determine the difference in odds between the two, we can calculate the ratio of the second odds to the first odds:

(1 / (39! / (5! * (39 - 5)!))) / (1 / (59! / (6! * (59 - 6)!)))

Simplifying this expression gives us:

(59! / (6! * (59 - 6)!)) / (39! / (5! * (39 - 5)!))

Evaluating this ratio gives us a value of approximately 1297.37.

Therefore, the odds of winning the lotto are approximately 1297.37 times greater when picking 5 numbers from a range of 1 to 39 compared to picking 6 numbers from a range of 1 to 59.
